# HyperSkillProjects
My hyperskill projects.

## Kotlin
I finished some essential parts of Kotlin projects.
I tried to code kotlin style code, using library functions and ohter grammatical features.

1. Parking Lot
2. Coffed Machine
3. Simple chatty Bot
4. FlashCards
5. Minesweeper
6. Numeric Matrix Processor

..are them.

But I'll keep code Kotlin-like codes.  
So other projects, like python projects or java, will also have their kotlin version files.


## Java
Kotlin is made from Java.  
So it is good for Kotlin programmers to learn Java to understand more about kotlin.  
Even more,hyperskill java projects contains some important features like regex that kotlin projects don't.  
So here is java projects.  
But as I mentioned, Kotlin is first, so java projects might not contain java file but kotlin one.
